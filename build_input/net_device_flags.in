/**
 * enum net_device_flags - &struct net_device flags
 *
 * These are the &struct net_device flags, they can be set by drivers, the
 * kernel and some can be triggered by userspace. Userspace can query and
 * set these flags using userspace utilities but there is also a sysfs
 * entry available for all dev flags which can be queried and set. These flags
 * are shared for all types of net_devices. The sysfs entries are available
 * via /sys/class/net/<dev>/flags. Flags which can be toggled through sysfs
 * are annotated below, note that only a few flags can be toggled and some
 * other flags are always always preserved from the original net_device flags
 * even if you try to set them via sysfs. Flags which are always preserved
 * are kept under the flag grouping @IFF_VOLATILE. Flags which are __volatile__
 * are annotated below as such.
 *
 * You should have a pretty good reason to be extending these flags.
 *
 * @IFF_UP: interface is up. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_BROADCAST: broadcast address valid. Volatile.
 * @IFF_DEBUG: turn on debugging. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_LOOPBACK: is a loopback net. Volatile.
 * @IFF_POINTOPOINT: interface is has p-p link. Volatile.
 * @IFF_NOTRAILERS: avoid use of trailers. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 *	Volatile.
 * @IFF_RUNNING: interface RFC2863 OPER_UP. Volatile.
 * @IFF_NOARP: no ARP protocol. Can be toggled through sysfs. Volatile.
 * @IFF_PROMISC: receive all packets. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_ALLMULTI: receive all multicast packets. Can be toggled through
 *	sysfs.
 * @IFF_MASTER: master of a load balancer. Volatile.
 * @IFF_SLAVE: slave of a load balancer. Volatile.
 * @IFF_MULTICAST: Supports multicast. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_PORTSEL: can set media type. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_AUTOMEDIA: auto media select active. Can be toggled through sysfs.
 * @IFF_DYNAMIC: dialup device with changing addresses. Can be toggled
 *	through sysfs.
 * @IFF_LOWER_UP: driver signals L1 up. Volatile.
 * @IFF_DORMANT: driver signals dormant. Volatile.
 * @IFF_ECHO: echo sent packets. Volatile.
