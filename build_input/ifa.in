/*
 * Important comment:
 * IFA_ADDRESS is prefix address, rather than local interface address.
 * It makes no difference for normally configured broadcast interfaces,
 * but for point-to-point IFA_ADDRESS is DESTINATION address,
 * local address is supplied in IFA_LOCAL attribute.
 *
 * IFA_FLAGS is a u32 attribute that extends the u8 field ifa_flags.
 * If present, the value from struct ifaddrmsg will be ignored.
